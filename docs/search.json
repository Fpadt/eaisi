Drawing inspiration from the ancient myth of the Oracle of Delphi, where the Pythia‚Äîthe high priestess‚Äîdelivered cryptic prophecies, we harness the power of Data Science‚Äîour modern-day Pythia‚Äîto foresee future trends. Just as the Pythia‚Äôs prophecies required careful interpretation, our statistical and machine learning techniques produce Advice that requires human expertise for effective application. By embodying this union of technology and human insight, we aptly named our project Pythia‚Äôs Advice. This synergy ensures well-informed, data-driven decision-making and enhances the operational efficiency of the supply chain.\nAccording to ancient myth, the Pythia inhaled vapors emanating from the remnants of the Python slain by Apollo‚Äîthe Olympian god of the sun, music, and prophecy. These vapors induced a trance-like state that allowed her to channel his prophetic insights, revealing future events. Similarly, our project ‚Äòinhales‚Äô vast amounts of data‚Äîour ‚ÄòPython‚Äôs Vapors‚Äô‚Äîwhich, when processed with complex algorithms, enable us to decipher hidden patterns and unveil valuable foresight. However, these predictive insights must be carefully interpreted to avoid missteps‚Äîmuch like when King Croesus misread the Pythia‚Äôs prophecy that ‚Äòa great empire will fall.‚Äô He waged war and, in doing so, opened Pandora‚Äôs Box‚Äîleading to the downfall of his own great empire‚Äîthe Kingdom of Lydia.\nFurthermore, Pythia‚Äôs Advice emphasizes the crucial bond between humans and nature. By focusing on the sales forecast of food for biodiversity‚Äîproducts that support ecological diversity‚Äîwe aim to benefit human health and promote planetary well-being. This harmonious relationship mirrors the Pythia‚Äôs sacred connection with the divine, symbolizing a balance between technological capabilities and the natural world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur logo, featuring a tree integrated with the Pythia through conductive traces against an enlightening sunset that symbolizes guidance and inspiration, beautifully encapsulates this synergy. This imagery symbolizes the fusion of natural wisdom and technological innovation. It reminds us that while we rely on cutting-edge technology to predict the future, our roots remain deeply intertwined with nature.\nThrough Pythia‚Äôs Advice, we honor the legacy of the Oracle of Delphi, blending ancient wisdom with modern technology to illuminate the path forward.\n\n\n\n\nBarrett, T, Dowle, M, Srinivasan, A, Gorecki, J, Chirico, M, Hocking, T, Schwendinger, B, Stetsenko, P, Short, T, Lianoglou, S, Antonyan, E, Bonsch, M, Parsonage, H, Ritchie, S, Ren, K, Tan, X, Saporta, R, Seiskari, O, Dong, X, Lang, M, Iwasaki, W, Wenchel, S, Broman, K, Schmidt, T, Arenburg, D, Smith, E, Cocquemas, F, Gomez, M, Chataignon, P, Blaser, N, Selivanov, D, Riabushenko, A, Lee, C, Groves, D, Possenriede, D, Parages, F, Toth, D, Yaramaz-David, M, Perumal, A, Sams, J, Morgan, M, Quinn, M, @javrucebo, @marc-outins, Storey, R, Saraswat, M, Jacob, M, Schubmehl, M, Vaughan, D, Silvestri, L, Hester, J, Damico, A, Freundt, S, Simons, D, Andrade, E S de, Miller, C, Meldgaard, J P, Tlapak, V, Ushey, K, Eddelbuettel, D, Fischetti, T, Shilon, O, Khotilovich, V, Wickham, H, Becker, B, Haynes, K, Kamgang, B C, Delmarcell, O, O‚ÄôBrien, J, Mezquita, D de, Czekanski, M, Shemetov, D, Jha, N, Wu, J, Gin√©-V√°zquez, I, Chetia, A, Amoakohene, D, and Krylov, I 2024 Data.table: Extension of ‚Äôdata.frame‚Äô.

    "text": "Introduction\nIn an increasingly complex market environment, accurate demand forecasting is critical for ensuring the operational efficiency of supply chains, particularly in industries like wholesale, where products are perishable and sales are affected by seasonality and promotions. This research focuses on a wholesale company that buys, produces, and distributes biodiversity food to retailers, Out-Of-Home, discounters and E-commerce. To make informed decisions regarding production, buying, and negotiation with customers, accurate sales forecasts are required at different aggregation levels, depending on each use case.\nWhile the company employs robust but dated statistical methods, such as moving averages and exponential smoothing, these techniques struggle to handle promotional impacts, capture complex sales patterns, and provide prediction intervals. Currently, a combination of bottom-up and top-down forecasting approaches is used, largely determined by the judgment of individual demand planners. However, the lack of clear guidance on which approach to apply in different scenarios has resulted in inconsistent and subjective forecasting outcomes. Furthermore, various use cases have distinct aggregation and time horizon requirements, adding complexity to maintaining consistent and accurate forecasts across the system.\nThe primary objective of this research is to determine the best way to generate a forecast, which methods to use and on what levels of granularity, enabling consistent, accurate forecasts that can be aggregated or dis-aggregated as required for different business needs. Specifically, the study aims to address the following key questions:\nUltimately, this research will provide an objective, data-driven strategy to improve forecast accuracy, reduce reliance on individual intuition, and ensure that forecasts are robust, consistent, and scalable across multiple aggregation levels, thereby enhancing overall decision-making efficiency.",

    "text": "Background\nThe company‚Äôs forecasting requirements vary significantly across several key use cases, among others:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsupply chain network (sample)\n\n\n\nBuying and Production: Requires forecasts at the material level and warehouse, aggregated weekly, with a forecast horizon of 12 weeks.\nSetting Safety Stock Profiles: Requires forecasts at the material level and warehouse, aggregated weekly, with a forecast horizon of 26-52 weeks, to determine safety stock profiles based on realized forecast accuracy.\nNegotiation with Customers: Requires forecasts at a monthly level, aggregated by material categories and customer groups, with a horizon of 6 months.\nProduction Cost Calculation: Requires forecasts at a quarterly level, aggregated by material, with a horizon of 6 quarters, grouped into annual time buckets.\n\nThe primary forecasting challenge is determining the optimal aggregation level and methods to use for generating forecasts that can meet the desired forecast accuracy of these different use cases while ensuring consistency and accuracy.\nThis inconsistency stems from a lack of objective criteria for selecting between forecasting methods‚Äîbottom-up, top-down, or middle-out‚Äîresulting in decisions that rely on the subjective judgment of demand planners, leading to variable performance and inefficiencies.\n\n\nBusiness Objectives\nThe primary objective is to enhance operational efficiency by improving forecast accuracy across all key use cases. This will be achieved through the application of robust forecasting methods that can handle seasonality, promotions, and efficiently allocate scarce resources. Ultimately, these improvements will contribute to improved stock levels and a higher level of customer satisfaction, both key strategic goals for the company.\n\n\nBusiness Success Criteria\nSuccess will be measured by the following criteria:\n\nImproved Forecast Accuracy:\n\nTailored Forecasts for Each Use Case: Enhanced accuracy across areas such as buying, production, safety stock settings, and customer negotiations, using methods that account for seasonality, promotions, and varying aggregation levels.\nReduced Forecast Errors and Bias: Measurable reductions in key error metrics like RMSE , MAPE , and BIAS will lead to better alignment between forecasted and actual sales. Increased accuracy will also foster trust among supply planners, reducing the need for excessive safety margins.\nConsistency Across Aggregation Levels: Forecasts will remain consistent across different levels of aggregation, ensuring that detailed and aggregated forecasts are aligned.\n\nInformed Decision-Making for Forecasting System Functionality:\n\nSelecting the Right Forecasting Methods: This research will guide the selection of optimal forecasting methods (statistical, machine learning, or hybrid) to improve performance across various use cases.\nEfficient Resource Allocation: A product classification scheme (e.g., ABC-XYZ) will be developed to help demand planners focus on high-impact products, while low-impact products will be managed more efficiently through automated forecasts.\n\nOperational Benefits:\n\nImproved Inventory Management: More accurate forecasts will drive better purchasing and production decisions, leading to:\n\nReduced Out-of-Stock (OOS) Incidents: Ensuring product availability to meet customer demand and reduce penalties from stock-outs.\nReduced Out-of-Date (OOD) Incidents: Minimizing waste and ensuring the freshness of perishable goods, leading to lower storage costs and better inventory turnover.\n\nOptimized Safety Stock Levels: Accurate forecasts will allow for better safety stock settings, reducing both overstocking and stock-outs.\nCost Optimization: Improved demand alignment will lower excess inventory and warehousing costs, minimize spoilage, and reduce costs associated with last-minute adjustments and overproduction.\n\nEnhanced Supply Chain Efficiency and Decision-Making:\n\nStrategic Decision Support: Consistent and accurate forecasts will improve decision-making across production planning, sales target setting, capacity management, and workforce optimization. These improvements will also support better customer negotiations and more precise COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) calculations, resulting in a more efficient supply chain.\nIncreased Customer Satisfaction: Improved product availability, fewer stock-outs, and fresher goods will not only reduce operational costs but will also enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty‚Äîa core strategic objective of the company.\n\n\nBy achieving these objectives, the company will see significant improvements in operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and most importantly, a higher level of customer satisfaction, which will ultimately drive long-term business success.\nsee upper part of the flow-down graph, (Flow-down).\n\n\nInventory of Resources Requirements\n\nData sources:\nThe available data includes historical sales, promotional data, stock quantities, and previous forecasts. Stock-out periods will be adjusted for by inflating sales to reflect demand that would have occurred had stock been available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Type\nDetails\nTime Span\n\n\n\n\nSales\nCustomer Orders, Inter-company, Returns, Free-of-Charge and Missed\n&gt; 2020\n\n\nPromotions\nPromotions per material and customer\n&gt; 2020\n\n\nStock\nDaily stock level per material and distribution center\n&gt; 2020\n\n\nForecasts\ngenerated forecast before- and after Demand Review\n&gt; Aug.¬†2023\n\n\nMaster data\nMaterial, Customer and Organization, including hierarchy‚Äôs\nN.A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScoping\nThe scope of the project consist of two Marketing & Sales Organizations (MSO), with a focus on 6 brands, representing 5 out of the 6 categories, see Table¬†3.1. These materials are made-to-stock (MTS), requirements are planned on a weekly level, which represents 97% of the business.\nThis leaves us with about 1.000 materials out of 9.000 to focus on, making the assumption that these are representative for the rest of the products.\n\n\n\nTable¬†3.1: Brands and Categories\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nBjorg\nDairy\n\n\nClipper\nTea / Coffee\n\n\nNaturela\nTea / Coffee\n\n\nTanoshi\nMeals\n\n\nAlter Eco\nSweets\n\n\nZonnatura\nBreakfast Cereals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Mining Goals\nPredictive Model based on Correlations: Forecast Future Sales + Promotion effects\nsee lower part of the flow-down graph, (Flow-down).\n\nData and Forecasting Methods\nWe will employ a combination of statistical methods and machine learning techniques to improve the forecasting process:\n\nCurrent Methods: The company‚Äôs current forecasting system uses moving averages, exponential smoothing and Box-Jenkins, which face challenges with Seasonality, Stationarity and promotional effects. Forecasts are often inadequate in handling the impacts of promotions.\nProposed Methods:\n\nETS (Error, Trend, Seasonal): To replace exponential smoothing with a model that provides prediction intervals and better captures trends and seasonality.\nHTS (Hierarchical Time Series): To handle multiple aggregation levels, ensuring forecast consistency when forecasts are disaggregated or aggregated across levels.\nXGBoost: A machine learning technique capable of handling promotional impacts and even identifying cannibalization effects of promotions between products.\nconformal prediction: A method that provides prediction intervals and calibrated forecasts, ensuring that the forecasted values are within a certain confidence level.\nCatBoost and SHAP: These will be used for feature analysis, determining which features (e.g., promotions, stock-outs) have the highest impact on forecast accuracy. This approach helps in choosing relevant input features to improve forecasts.\n\n\n\n\nConsistency and Validation\nOne key requirement is ensuring that forecasts remain consistent across different levels of aggregation. This is where HTS will play a crucial role, reconciling forecasts generated at different aggregation levels to ensure that top-level forecasts align with aggregated lower-level forecasts. This will address the known issue of discrepancies between aggregated forecasts and directly forecasted aggregated levels.\n\n\nHuman Resources Allocation\nThe team consists of X demand planners working across Y MSOs. Currently, planners are involved in manually indicating promotional impacts and adjusting forecasts based on intuition, without systematic data cleaning for stock-outs or model tuning.\nTo optimize resource allocation, we plan to implement a classification system for the company‚Äôs 9K SKUs, utilizing an:\nABC-XYZ classification scheme:\n\nABC Classification: Based on sales volume‚Äîfocusing more resources on high-value items (A-class) and minimizing attention to low-volume items (C-class).\nXYZ Classification: Based on sales variability, indicating which products have stable demand versus those with erratic patterns.\nCombined Classification: These classifications will guide planners in determining where their efforts can have the most impact, focusing primarily on high-priority items while relying more on automated processes for low-priority ones.\n\n\n\n\nData Mining Success Criteria\nThe fiinal result will show an estimated relationship between forecast accuracy and the cost of resources required for the agreed scope. The cost of resources result from hardware, software and human resources needed for cleansing data, transforming data, model tuning and other manual activities needed.\nTo assess forecast accuracy, we will use a range of evaluation metrics tailored to each use case.\nThese metrics will help evaluate how well each approach performs against the unique requirements of each use case, ultimately guiding method selection and refinement.\n\nRMSE (Root Mean Squared Error, def¬†3.2 ): The primary metric for measuring forecast accuracy, particularly useful for penalizing large errors.\nMAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): To align with existing company metrics.\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error): Additional metrics to provide a broader evaluation, addressing different aspects of forecast performance and comparing models to na√Øve baselines.\n\n\n\nProject Plan\nsee Project Plan\n\nInitial Assessment of Tools and Techniques\nsee Literature review (Literature)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef 3.1 OOD:\nOut of Date\n\n\ndef 3.2 RMSE:\nRoot Mean Squared Error\nRMSE = \\(\\sqrt{mean(e^2_t)}\\)\nA Scale-dependent error, to compare forecast performances between data sets with the same unit.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarrett, T, Dowle, M, Srinivasan, A, Gorecki, J, Chirico, M, Hocking, T, Schwendinger, B, Stetsenko, P, Short, T, Lianoglou, S, Antonyan, E, Bonsch, M, Parsonage, H, Ritchie, S, Ren, K, Tan, X, Saporta, R, Seiskari, O, Dong, X, Lang, M, Iwasaki, W, Wenchel, S, Broman, K, Schmidt, T, Arenburg, D, Smith, E, Cocquemas, F, Gomez, M, Chataignon, P, Blaser, N, Selivanov, D, Riabushenko, A, Lee, C, Groves, D, Possenriede, D, Parages, F, Toth, D, Yaramaz-David, M, Perumal, A, Sams, J, Morgan, M, Quinn, M, @javrucebo, @marc-outins, Storey, R, Saraswat, M, Jacob, M, Schubmehl, M, Vaughan, D, Silvestri, L, Hester, J, Damico, A, Freundt, S, Simons, D, Andrade, E S de, Miller, C, Meldgaard, J P, Tlapak, V, Ushey, K, Eddelbuettel, D, Fischetti, T, Shilon, O, Khotilovich, V, Wickham, H, Becker, B, Haynes, K, Kamgang, B C, Delmarcell, O, O‚ÄôBrien, J, Mezquita, D de, Czekanski, M, Shemetov, D, Jha, N, Wu, J, Gin√©-V√°zquez, I, Chetia, A, Amoakohene, D, and Krylov, I 2024 Data.table: Extension of ‚Äôdata.frame‚Äô.

The use of Feather format ensures fast data loading, which is important for applications where user wait time during startup should be minimized.\nIf your dataset grows or your scalability needs change, you might need to adjust the workflow accordingly, possibly by switching to Parquet files and leveraging DuckDB‚Äôs capabilities to handle larger datasets more efficiently.\nArchitecture\nScalability:\n\nadjust your SQL queries to limit the data loaded into memory, ensuring your application remains performant.\nscale vertically with increased RAM and CPU cores to manage larger Feather files and more complex algorithms without architectural changes.\n\nPerformance:\n\nFeather enables fast reads for smaller datasets during startup.\nDuckDB efficiently handles larger datasets by querying on disk and loading only the necessary data into memory.\n\n\n\nData Stageing\n\nD00: contains the BW OpenHub Export, CSV - same as AL11\n\n\n\nData Ingestion:\nOccurs once a month, converting CSV to Parquet (or another format). header is added and stored in D01\n\n\nData Access and Querying:\n\nData is imported into R data.table objects via DuckDB, which reads the stored files.\nQueries are often simple SQL SELECT statements on one table or basic INNER JOINs.\nThe same SQL queries are used to import data into Python using Polars via DuckDB.\n\n\n\nData Manipulation:\n\nFurther data manipulation in R is done using data.table.\nIn Python, data manipulation is performed using Polars.\n\nEvaluation of Your Proposed Workflow\nGiven your familiarity with SQL and DuckDB, and your need for scalability, your proposed workflow is sound and aligns well with your goals.\n\n\nAdvantages of Your Workflow\n\nScalability\n\nEfficient Data Storage: Parquet files are columnar, compressed, and optimized for performance, which is beneficial for large datasets.\nQuery Optimization: DuckDB is designed for efficient analytical queries, even on large datasets.\n\nFlexibility\n\nLanguage Agnostic: DuckDB can be used within R and Python, allowing seamless transition between languages.\nSQL Familiarity: Your proficiency in SQL means you can leverage DuckDB‚Äôs SQL interface effectively.\n\nPerformance\n\n\nFast Query Execution: DuckDB is optimized for OLAP workloads and can execute complex queries quickly.\nDirect Parquet Support: DuckDB can read Parquet files directly without the need to load the entire dataset into memory.\n\n\nIntegration with R and Python\n\n\nR Data.Tables: You can fetch query results from DuckDB into R data.tables, integrating with your existing R codebase.\nPython Polars: Similarly, you can read data into Polars DataFrames in Python, which is efficient for data manipulation.\n\n\nSimplified Data Pipeline\n\n\nUnified Data Source: Using DuckDB on top of Parquet files centralizes your data access, simplifying data management.\n\n\n\nPotential Disadvantages\n\nAdditional Complexity\n\n\nLibrary Dependencies: Requires installation and management of additional libraries (DuckDB, Parquet support in R and Python).\nLearning Curve for Integration: Even though you‚Äôre familiar with DuckDB, integrating it into R and Python workflows may require some setup and testing.\n\n\nOverhead of Data Conversion\n\nInitial Conversion: Migrating CSV files to Parquet adds an extra step in your data ingestion pipeline.\nData Updates: If your CSV data updates frequently, you‚Äôll need to automate the conversion process.\n\nResource Usage\n\n\nDisk Space: Maintaining both CSV and Parquet files (if not deleting the original CSVs) may consume additional storage.\n\n\nRecommendations and Best Practices\nGiven your requirements and skills, your proposed workflow is suitable and offers several benefits in terms of scalability and flexibility. Here are some recommendations to optimize your workflow:\n### 1. Automate the CSV to Parquet Conversion\n\nUse Batch Processing:\nCreate scripts in R or Python to automate the conversion of CSV files to Parquet.\nLeverage DuckDB for Conversion:\n\nDuckDB can read CSV files and write Parquet files, allowing you to perform the conversion within DuckDB.\n\n\nCOPY (SELECT * FROM 'your_data.csv') TO 'your_data.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);\n\n\n2. Optimize DuckDB Usage\n\nIndexing and Partitioning:\n\nWhile Parquet files do not support traditional indexing, consider partitioning your data to improve query performance.\n\nSQL Query Optimization:\n\nUse DuckDB‚Äôs advanced SQL features to optimize queries (e.g., window functions, common table expressions).\n\n\n\n\n3. Efficient Data Retrieval into R and Python\n\nIn R:\n\nUse the duckdb package to execute SQL queries and fetch results into data.tables.\n\nlibrary(duckdb)\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())\n\n# Query data\nresult &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, \"SELECT * FROM 'your_data.parquet' WHERE conditions\")\n\n# Convert to data.table\nlibrary(data.table)\ndt_result &lt;- as.data.table(result)\nIn Python with Polars:\n\nUse DuckDB‚Äôs Python API or integrate with Polars for efficient data handling.\n\n\nimport duckdb\nimport polars as pl\n\n# Execute query and fetch result as Polars DataFrame\ndf = duckdb.query(\"SELECT * FROM 'your_data.parquet' WHERE conditions\").to_df()\npl_df = pl.from_pandas(df)\n\n\n4. Consider Data Volume and Hardware Resources\n\nMemory Management:\n\nDuckDB processes data efficiently, but ensure your hardware resources are adequate for your data size.\n\nDisk I/O:\n\nUsing Parquet files reduces disk I/O due to compression, but be mindful of the storage subsystem performance.\n\n\n\n\n5. Keep Libraries Updated\n\nStay Current:\n\nEnsure that you are using the latest versions of DuckDB, R packages, and Python libraries to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes.\n\n\n\n\n6. Handle Updates and Data Versioning\n\nIncremental Updates:\n\nIf your data updates incrementally, design your pipeline to handle partial updates rather than reprocessing entire datasets.\n\nData Version Control:\n\nImplement versioning for your Parquet files to track changes over time.\n\n\n\n\n7. Monitor Performance and Adjust\n\nBenchmarking:\n\nRegularly benchmark query performance to identify bottlenecks.\n\nAdjust Strategy:\n\nBased on performance metrics, adjust partitioning schemes, query strategies, or hardware resources as needed.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nYour proposed workflow of migrating CSV files to Parquet, using DuckDB for querying, and integrating with R and Python is a robust solution that addresses your needs for scalability and flexibility. Given your familiarity with SQL and DuckDB, and the fact that you possess the necessary skills to manage the additional complexity, this approach is well-suited to your situation.\nBenefits of Your Workflow:\n\nScalable Data Processing:\nEfficient handling of large datasets through Parquet and DuckDB.\nFlexibility Across Languages:\n\nSeamless data access in both R and Python without data format conversion issues.\n\nPerformance Optimization:\n\nFaster query execution and data retrieval due to optimized storage and processing.\n\n\nKey Actions Moving Forward:\n\nSet Up Automated Data Pipelines:\n\n\nAutomate the conversion from CSV to Parquet to ensure consistency and save time.\n\n\nOptimize Queries:\n\n\nUtilize DuckDB‚Äôs full SQL capabilities to write efficient queries for your analysis.\n\n\nIntegrate Smoothly with R and Python:\n\nEstablish standard functions or scripts in both environments to interact with DuckDB, minimizing repetitive code.\n\nMonitor and Iterate:\n\nKeep an eye on performance metrics and be ready to adjust your approach as your dataset grows or changes.\n\n\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\nCommunity and Support:\n\nDuckDB is actively developed, and there is a growing community. Utilize resources like documentation and forums when needed.\n\nTesting and Validation:\n\nAs with any data pipeline, thoroughly test each component to ensure data integrity and correctness.\n\nSecurity and Access Control:\n\nIf working in a multi-user environment, consider how data access and permissions are managed.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nYour willingness to embrace additional complexity due to your skill set positions you well to benefit from this workflow. By combining the strengths of Parquet‚Äôs efficient data storage and DuckDB‚Äôs powerful query engine, you can achieve a scalable and flexible data analysis environment.\nShould you need further assistance or have more questions as you implement this workflow, feel free to reach out.
