    "text": "Introduction\nIn an increasingly complex market environment, accurate demand forecasting is critical for ensuring the operational efficiency of supply chains, particularly in industries like wholesale, where products are perishable and sales are affected by seasonality and promotions. This research focuses on a wholesale company that buys, produces, and distributes biodiversity food to retailers, Out-Of-Home, discounters and E-commerce. To make informed decisions regarding production, buying, and negotiation with customers, accurate sales forecasts are required at different aggregation levels, depending on each use case.\nWhile the company employs robust but dated statistical methods, such as moving averages and exponential smoothing, these techniques struggle to handle promotional impacts, capture complex sales patterns, and provide prediction intervals. Currently, a combination of bottom-up and top-down forecasting approaches is used, largely determined by the judgment of individual demand planners. However, the lack of clear guidance on which approach to apply in different scenarios has resulted in inconsistent and subjective forecasting outcomes. Furthermore, various use cases have distinct aggregation and time horizon requirements, adding complexity to maintaining consistent and accurate forecasts across the system.\nThe primary objective of this research is to determine the best way to generate a forecast, which methods to use and on what levels of granularity, enabling consistent, accurate forecasts that can be aggregated or dis-aggregated as required for different business needs. Specifically, the study aims to address the following key questions:\nUltimately, this research will provide an objective, data-driven strategy to improve forecast accuracy, reduce reliance on individual intuition, and ensure that forecasts are robust, consistent, and scalable across multiple aggregation levels, thereby enhancing overall decision-making efficiency.",

    "text": "3.1.1 Background\nThe company‚Äôs forecasting requirements vary significantly across several key use cases, among others:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsupply chain network (sample)\n\n\n\nBuying and Production: Requires forecasts at the material level and warehouse, aggregated weekly, with a forecast horizon of 12 weeks.\nSetting Safety Stock Profiles: Requires forecasts at the material level and warehouse, aggregated weekly, with a forecast horizon of 26-52 weeks, to determine safety stock profiles based on realized forecast accuracy.\nNegotiation with Customers: Requires forecasts at a monthly level, aggregated by material categories and customer groups, with a horizon of 6 months.\nProduction Cost Calculation: Requires forecasts at a quarterly level, aggregated by material, with a horizon of 6 quarters, grouped into annual time buckets.\n\nThe primary forecasting challenge is determining the optimal aggregation level and methods to use for generating forecasts that can meet the desired forecast accuracy of these different use cases while ensuring consistency and accuracy.\nThis inconsistency stems from a lack of objective criteria for selecting between forecasting methods‚Äîbottom-up, top-down, or middle-out‚Äîresulting in decisions that rely on the subjective judgment of demand planners, leading to variable performance and inefficiencies.\n\n\n3.1.2 Business Objectives\nThe primary objective is to enhance operational efficiency by improving forecast accuracy across all key use cases. This will be achieved through the application of robust forecasting methods that can handle seasonality, promotions, and efficiently allocate scarce resources. Ultimately, these improvements will contribute to improved stock levels and a higher level of customer satisfaction, both key strategic goals for the company.\n\n\n3.1.3 Business Success Criteria\nSuccess will be measured by the following criteria:\n\nImproved Forecast Accuracy:\n\nTailored Forecasts for Each Use Case: Enhanced accuracy across areas such as buying, production, safety stock settings, and customer negotiations, using methods that account for seasonality, promotions, and varying aggregation levels.\nReduced Forecast Errors and Bias: Measurable reductions in key error metrics like RMSE , MAPE , and BIAS will lead to better alignment between forecasted and actual sales. Increased accuracy will also foster trust among supply planners, reducing the need for excessive safety margins.\nConsistency Across Aggregation Levels: Forecasts will remain consistent across different levels of aggregation, ensuring that detailed and aggregated forecasts are aligned.\n\nInformed Decision-Making for Forecasting System Functionality:\n\nSelecting the Right Forecasting Methods: This research will guide the selection of optimal forecasting methods (statistical, machine learning, or hybrid) to improve performance across various use cases.\nEfficient Resource Allocation: A product classification scheme (e.g., ABC-XYZ) will be developed to help demand planners focus on high-impact products, while low-impact products will be managed more efficiently through automated forecasts.\n\nOperational Benefits:\n\nImproved Inventory Management: More accurate forecasts will drive better purchasing and production decisions, leading to:\n\nReduced Out-of-Stock (OOS) Incidents: Ensuring product availability to meet customer demand and reduce penalties from stock-outs.\nReduced Out-of-Date (OOD) Incidents: Minimizing waste and ensuring the freshness of perishable goods, leading to lower storage costs and better inventory turnover.\n\nOptimized Safety Stock Levels: Accurate forecasts will allow for better safety stock settings, reducing both overstocking and stock-outs.\nCost Optimization: Improved demand alignment will lower excess inventory and warehousing costs, minimize spoilage, and reduce costs associated with last-minute adjustments and overproduction.\n\nEnhanced Supply Chain Efficiency and Decision-Making:\n\nStrategic Decision Support: Consistent and accurate forecasts will improve decision-making across production planning, sales target setting, capacity management, and workforce optimization. These improvements will also support better customer negotiations and more precise COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) calculations, resulting in a more efficient supply chain.\nIncreased Customer Satisfaction: Improved product availability, fewer stock-outs, and fresher goods will not only reduce operational costs but will also enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty‚Äîa core strategic objective of the company.\n\n\nBy achieving these objectives, the company will see significant improvements in operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and most importantly, a higher level of customer satisfaction, which will ultimately drive long-term business success.\nsee upper part of the flow-down graph, (?sec-flowdown).\n\n\n3.1.4 Inventory of Resources Requirements\n\n3.1.4.1 Data sources:\nThe available data includes historical sales, promotional data, stock quantities, and previous forecasts. Stock-out periods will be adjusted for by inflating sales to reflect demand that would have occurred had stock been available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Type\nDetails\nTime Span\n\n\n\n\nSales\nCustomer Orders, Inter-company, Returns, Free-of-Charge and Missed\n&gt; 2020\n\n\nPromotions\nPromotions per material and customer\n&gt; 2020\n\n\nStock\nDaily stock level per material and distribution center\n&gt; 2020\n\n\nForecasts\ngenerated forecast before- and after Demand Review\n&gt; Aug.¬†2023\n\n\nMaster data\nMaterial, Customer and Organization, including hierarchy‚Äôs\nN.A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4.2 Scoping\nThe scope of the project consist of two Marketing & Sales Organizations (MSO), with a focus on 6 brands, representing 5 out of the 6 categories, see Table¬†3.1. These materials are made-to-stock (MTS), requirements are planned on a weekly level, which represents 97% of the business.\nThis leaves us with about 1.000 materials out of 9.000 to focus on, making the assumption that these are representative for the rest of the products.\n\n\n\nTable¬†3.1: Brands and Categories\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nBjorg\nDairy\n\n\nClipper\nTea / Coffee\n\n\nNaturela\nTea / Coffee\n\n\nTanoshi\nMeals\n\n\nAlter Eco\nSweets\n\n\nZonnatura\nBreakfast Cereals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Data Mining Goals\nPredictive Model based on Correlations: Forecast Future Sales + Promotion effects\nsee lower part of the flow-down graph, (?sec-flowdown).\n\nData and Forecasting Methods\nWe will employ a combination of statistical methods and machine learning techniques to improve the forecasting process:\n\nCurrent Methods: The company‚Äôs current forecasting system uses moving averages, exponential smoothing and Box-Jenkins, which face challenges with Seasonality, Stationarity and promotional effects. Forecasts are often inadequate in handling the impacts of promotions.\nProposed Methods:\n\nETS (Error, Trend, Seasonal): To replace exponential smoothing with a model that provides prediction intervals and better captures trends and seasonality.\nHTS (Hierarchical Time Series): To handle multiple aggregation levels, ensuring forecast consistency when forecasts are disaggregated or aggregated across levels.\nXGBoost: A machine learning technique capable of handling promotional impacts and even identifying cannibalization effects of promotions between products.\nconformal prediction: A method that provides prediction intervals and calibrated forecasts, ensuring that the forecasted values are within a certain confidence level.\nCatBoost and SHAP: These will be used for feature analysis, determining which features (e.g., promotions, stock-outs) have the highest impact on forecast accuracy. This approach helps in choosing relevant input features to improve forecasts.\n\n\n\n\nConsistency and Validation\nOne key requirement is ensuring that forecasts remain consistent across different levels of aggregation. This is where HTS will play a crucial role, reconciling forecasts generated at different aggregation levels to ensure that top-level forecasts align with aggregated lower-level forecasts. This will address the known issue of discrepancies between aggregated forecasts and directly forecasted aggregated levels.\n\n\n3.1.5.1 Human Resources Allocation\nThe team consists of X demand planners working across Y MSOs. Currently, planners are involved in manually indicating promotional impacts and adjusting forecasts based on intuition, without systematic data cleaning for stock-outs or model tuning.\nTo optimize resource allocation, we plan to implement a classification system for the company‚Äôs 9K SKUs, utilizing an:\nABC-XYZ classification scheme:\n\nABC Classification: Based on sales volume‚Äîfocusing more resources on high-value items (A-class) and minimizing attention to low-volume items (C-class).\nXYZ Classification: Based on sales variability, indicating which products have stable demand versus those with erratic patterns.\nCombined Classification: These classifications will guide planners in determining where their efforts can have the most impact, focusing primarily on high-priority items while relying more on automated processes for low-priority ones.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.6 Data Mining Success Criteria\nThe fiinal result will show an estimated relationship between forecast accuracy and the cost of resources required for the agreed scope. The cost of resources result from hardware, software and human resources needed for cleansing data, transforming data, model tuning and other manual activities needed.\nTo assess forecast accuracy, we will use a range of evaluation metrics tailored to each use case.\nThese metrics will help evaluate how well each approach performs against the unique requirements of each use case, ultimately guiding method selection and refinement.\n\nRMSE (Root Mean Squared Error, def¬†3.1 ): The primary metric for measuring forecast accuracy, particularly useful for penalizing large errors.\nMAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): To align with existing company metrics.\nMAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error): Additional metrics to provide a broader evaluation, addressing different aspects of forecast performance and comparing models to na√Øve baselines.\n\n\n\n3.1.7 Project Plan\nsee ?sec-project-plan\n\n3.1.7.1 Initial Assessment of Tools and Techniques\nsee Literature review (?sec-literature_review)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef 3.1 RMSE:\nRoot Mean Squared Error\nRMSE = \\(\\sqrt{mean(e^2_t)}\\)\nA Scale-dependent error, to compare forecast performances between data sets with the same unit.",
