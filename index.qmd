  Effective business planning relies heavily on consistent and accurate 
  forecasts across various levels of aggregation, granularity, and time 
  horizons. Generating multiple forecasts for different use cases not only 
  incurs costs that should be justified by the benefits but also introduces 
  the risk of inconsistencies between forecasts. Ideally, a single detailed 
  forecast with a long horizon can be created and then aggregated to meet all 
  business needs, maintaining consistency but potentially sacrificing forecast 
  accuracy This raises the question of which approach delivers the highest 
  net benefit.

  To create an internal benchmark and understand the cost-benefit relationship 
  without disrupting normal business operations, we built a separate 
  forecasting lab environment in parallel to our production forecasting system, 
  leveraging state-of-the-art open-source software available free of charge. 
  We begin with simple models using raw historical sales data and gradually 
  increase complexity by automating data cleaning and incorporating more 
  advanced methods that utilize factors such as price, promotions, stock-outs, 
  and other external influences.

  While statistical forecasting methods are known for their robustness and 
  explainability, incorporating exogenous variables such as price and 
  promotions is often difficult. In an increasingly promotion-driven business 
  environment, recent machine learning models‚Äîsuch as Random Forest, neural 
  networks, and conformal prediction‚Äîmight deliver a higher net benefit despite 
  the additional data handling costs and reduced explainability.

  In assessing the effectiveness of various forecasting methods, we face the 
  challenge of directly quantifying the value each forecast brings to the 
  business. Due to the complexity of isolating a forecast's impact on business 
  performance, we adopt forecast accuracy as a proxy for forecast value. 
  This approach allows us to evaluate and compare the methods based on their 
  predictive precision, under the premise that more accurate forecasts are 
  likely to result in better-informed business decisions and, consequently, 
  greater operational benefits.

  In this paper, we aim to strike the right balance between enhancing forecast 
  accuracy and managing the costs associated with additional resources like 
  hardware, software, data, and human effort. Our research will explore the 
  optimal combination of forecasting methods to achieve higher accuracy while 
  ensuring efficient resource utilization. Furthermore, given the extensive 
  range of products (SKUs) and their varying levels of importance, we explore 
  strategies for effectively allocating human resources. By prioritizing 
  efforts on key products and automating processes for less critical items, 
  we aim to optimize resource utilization and enhance overall 
  forecasting efficiency.
